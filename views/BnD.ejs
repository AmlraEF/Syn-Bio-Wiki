<h1>Background</h1>
<br>
<h3><strong>First of all, what is synthetic biology?</strong></h3>
<p>Synthetic biology is an engineering approach to biology. Through a process of increasing abstraction, engineers use sequences of DNA to form genetic parts, use these parts to build devices, and then combine these devices into circuits and systems. All of this must occur within a living organism, or &lsquo;chassis&rsquo;, and therein lies the field&rsquo;s unique challenge - how to harness, unpredictable cellular processes for our own ends? It is against this backdrop that our project is set.</p>
<h3><strong>How did synthetic biology start?</strong></h3>
<p>Synthetic biology began with the advent of molecular biology. Once scientists were able to harness molecular machinery to clone and modify DNA, they could begin to construct synthetic circuits using DNA. During the &lsquo;modules era&rsquo; of synthetic biology, several circuits that were initially confined to the realm of electrical engineering were then realised in living organisms. We are now in the &lsquo;systems era&rsquo;, where the emphasis is placed on potential applications of the circuits to medicine, bioenergy and the environment. <a href="#[1]">(D. E.

<h3><strong>How will we construct our design?</strong></h3>
<p>The registry of standard biological parts (link) is a growing database of characterized parts and devices in the form of &lsquo;Biobricks&rsquo;, which is a &lsquo;format&rsquo; of DNA containing a suffix and/or prefix (for cleaving, recognition, and ligation) around the desired coding region. When this database was started, the cloning strategy (method for assembling parts together) formed &lsquo;scars&rsquo; in the final product which are &lsquo;leftover&rsquo; codons from the restriction site in the prefix or suffix where the restriction enzymes bound. The Golden Gate cloning strategy (C. Engler <em>et al.</em>) made use of a type of enzyme that had a different cutting site from its recognition site, thus allowing for non-palindromic restriction sites and a scar-less assembly. CIDAR MoClo (link) is the latest &lsquo;one-pot&rsquo; assembly method, derived from Golden Gate cloning, that allows for a rapid and more cost-effective assembly. (S. V. Iverson <em>et al.</em>) The currently existing libraries with parts conforming to the MoClo format are designed for E. coli. We will be using MoClo to construct a working toggle switch and oscillator.</p>
<h3><strong>Applications</strong></h3>
<p>The toggle switch is of interest due to its plethora of biological applications. By coupling inducers to other molecules, synthetic mammalian biosensors based on toggle switches have been created for sensing signals such as antibiotics, temperature changes, quorum sensing molecules, gases and metabolites and gene expression. Potential future applications include optogenetic studies in mammals and plants, bioremediation, genetic therapy and clinical applications such as antibiotic development or anticancer &ldquo;kill switches&rdquo;. Upon successful construction, our goal is to test out different promoter pairs to construct a library of toggle switches.</p>
<p>An example of an oscillator-based clock is the human circadian rhythm. Problems arising with the deregulation of this rhythm at any level can be a source of morbidity. The similarity and compatibility with the oscillator built in synthetic biology gave rise to these three potential applications in drug delivery:</p>
<ul>
<li>Circadian rhythm and melatonin (E. R. Dodson and P. C. Zee): The sleep-wake cycle is regulated by the interaction between circadian and homeostatic processes. Phase irregularities between melatonin and light can results in sleep disorders such as: Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder, Advanced Sleep Phase Disorder and Free-Running Disorder. All require melatonin administration at specific times (just before bed, a few hours before bed, and so on). An oscillator could be used to fix melatonin phase delay.</li>
<li>Circadian rhythm and cancer (L. Fu and C. C. Lee, and F. Gu <em>et al</em>): Circadian rhythm regulates cancer-related biological functions such as: metabolism, immune regulation, DNA repair, cell cycle control, etc. Circadian disruption has been linked to prostate and breast cancer in animal models. The oscillator could be used in early stage cancer to restore circadian rhythm and prevent mutations due to incorrect mRNA splicing</li>
<li>Circadian rhythm and Insulin (B. Hellman <em>et al.</em> and L. Mejean <em>et al.</em>): Insulin/glucose levels in blood exhibit a circadian and ultradian rhythm in healthy subjects. One of the current challenges in treating diabetes is delivering insulin at as a close a dose as the body would receive with a healthy pancreas in order to avoid accumulating blood vessel damage. An implant near a portal vein of a capsule containing an oscillator producing insulin, in a loop that implements the glucose diffusing from the blood of the patient, could provide a very reliable insulin delivery mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Toggle Switch Design</strong></h3>
<p>The bistable toggle switch consists of two promoters and two repressors. The second operon is composed of the promoter 2, the repressor for promoter 1 called repressor 1 and a reporter GFP. Therefore, the GFP reports for the expression level of repressor 1. The figure below shows this design. Bistability of the toggle arises from the mutually inhibitory arrangement of the repressor genes.</p>
<p>In the absence of inducer there are two stable states possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>'low' state: repressor 2 is transcribed and repressor 1 is repressed</li>
<li>'high' state: repressor 1 (+GFP) is transcribed and repressor 2 is repressed</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming the switch is in a stable position, addition of inducer (IPTG, aTc or heat) for the repressed repressor causes full activation of transcription, until the originally active repressor is repressed. In this manner the inducers allow to switch between the two stable states. For example, for a pTAK plasmid, one promoter-repressor pair used is the Lac repressor (lacI) in conjunction with the Ptrc-2 promoter. The other promoter-repressor pair (P1, R1), uses PLs1con promoter in conjunction with a temperature-sensitive &lambda; repressor (cIts). Upon switching to high state, the plasmid will express GFPmut3 in the absence of inducer. Switching is accomplished by transiently introducing an inducer of the currently active repressor. The inducer permits the opposing repressor to be maximally transcribed until it stably represses the originally active promoter.</p>
<h3><strong>Oscillator Design</strong></h3>
<p>The modified repressilator (Potvin-Trottier <em>et al.</em>) is our chosen oscillator. It is modelled on the original repressilator (Elowitz and Leibler), with a few key modifications aiming to enhance the simplicity of the biochemical processes. To understand the modifications, we must first understand how the original repressilator works. It consists of a negative feedback loop of 3 promoters, each coding for a transcriptional repressor of the next promoter. This gene system succeeded in producing oscillations of the GFP concentration within many individual cells, however across the cell population these oscillations were out of phase with each other. The system was also highly noisy, with significant deviations in amplitude and period. Potvin-Trottier <em>et al. </em>made the following modifications to remedy these problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removal of degradation tags: the presence of degradation tags in the original repressilator induced competition for proteases which caused fluctuations to propagate via the proteolysis system. Removing the degradation tags reduced this source of error in the system.</li>
<li>Integration of reporter into the main repressilator plasmid: this was experimentally found to reduce the relative standard deviation in amplitude from 78% to 36%.</li>
<li>Incorporation of a titration sponge to absorb tetR molecules: the sponge was used to increase the threshold of derepression of the tetR-controlled promoter. This derepression usually occurs at an extremely low thresholds and was found to induce noise in the system. The raising of the derepression threshold by the titration sponge was experimentally found to reduce the variance of the period fourfold.</li>
</ul>
<p>They created an oscillator with a robust periodicity of 14 E. coli generations, that was insensitive to varying amplitudes and temperature. The simplifications made to the system allowed the cells to stay in phase for several hundred generations.</p>
